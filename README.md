# Air-Purifier
Air is one of the most essential elements for survival of living organisms. We not only donâ€™t require air, but also we require clean pollution free air for our survival.  Air purifiers can refresh stale air, reducing the chances of health issues caused by indoor pollutants, which can trigger respiratory infections or aggravate symptoms in asthma.
